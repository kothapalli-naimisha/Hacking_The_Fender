# Hacking_The_Fender
Hacking The Fender codecademy project
The Fender, a notorious computer hacker and general villain of the people, has compromised several top-secret passwords including your own. 

Mission of this project,
1. Acquire access to The Fenderâ€˜s systems,
2. Update his "passwords.txt" file to scramble the secret data and 
3. The last thing is to add the signature of Slash Null, a different hacker whose 
   nefarious deeds could be very conveniently halted by The Fender if they viewed Slash Null as a threat.

Language: Python
Module: Files to retrieve, manipulate, obscure, and create data in your quest for justice. 
Worked with CSV files and other text files in this exploration of the strength of Python file programming.
